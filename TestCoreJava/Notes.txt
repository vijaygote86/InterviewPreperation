Functional Interface in Java 8 :
1. Functional interface has only one abstract method.
2. Functional interface can have multiple default or static methods. 
3. Java.util.function has many functional interfaces:
	e.g. Predicate, BinaryOperator, Function
4. @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure interface will not have more than one abstract method.
5. Use of @FunctionalInterface annotation is optional.
6. Java does not support multiple inheritance but supports multiple interface inheritance hence introduced 
	functional interface.
7. Abstract class can define constructor. They are more structured and can have state associated with them.
